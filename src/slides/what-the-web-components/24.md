title: HTML is just HTML
---

- When written as HTML, web component attributes/props are just strings
- This limits declarative complexity somewhat
- These same attributes/props could be set imperatively via JS
- Lit offers custom converters to handle more complex data:

```html
<simple-button my-array-prop="['hello', 'there', 'friends']"></simple-button>
```
