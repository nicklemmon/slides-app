title: The shadow DOM is not perfect
---

- A custom button component means most features of the native HTML button element need to be re-implemented
- `id` association via common ARIA attributes like `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby` and `aria-controls` do not pierce shadow boundaries
- Events emitted from elements in the shadow DOM do not reach outside the shadow boundary, so custom events are required
- No equivalent of React context
- CSS custom properties _do_ pierce shadow boundaries!
- Some HTML elements cannot use slots (`table`), and others break from an a11y standpoint when used this way (`input[type="radio"]`)
