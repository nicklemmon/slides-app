title: The shadow DOM/shadow root
description: Encapsulation - but at what cost!? ðŸ˜¨

- A hidden DOM tree rendered attached to a custom element
- NOTHING goes in or out (sort of - more on that later)
- More terminology:
  - The _shadow host_ - the DOM node to which the shadow DOM is attached (usually the custom element tag)
  - The _shadow root_ - the root shadow DOM node
  - The _shadow boundary_ - the place where the shadow DOM ends and the light DOM begins
