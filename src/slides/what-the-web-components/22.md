title: Server rendering
---

- Web components instantiate via a class in the client
- Content rendered inside the shadow DOM cannot be server rendered as a result
- [The lit team is working on this problem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/ssr)
- The [declarative shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/) is being rolled out to partially address this
