title: Styling woes
---

- `:host()` can't be paired with other pseudo selectors like `:host + :host` for two adjacent elements of the same type
- `:slotted()` can only target _immediate_ slotted children
- Any styles on the host element lack encapsulation, and are easily overridden
- No great way to access parent styling - `:host-context` was supposed to handle this but Safari/Firefox are not agreeing to implement
- Shadow DOM elements cannot be styled directly from the outside - CSS `part` can be use to allow this with some rails in place:

```js
@customElement("my-custom-element")
class MyCustomElement extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <div part="style-me">
        <span part="or-style-me"></span>
        <button>I can't be styled from the outside</button>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}
```

```css
my-custom-element:part(style-me) {
  color: hotpink;
}

my-custom-element:part(or-style-me) {
  background-color: darkgray;
}

/* This one won't work */
my-custom-element button {
  background-color: hoptink;
}
```
