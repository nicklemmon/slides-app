title: Styling woes
---

- `:host()` can't be paired with other pseudo selectors like `:host + :host` for two adjacent elements of the same type
- `:slotted()` can only target _immediate_ slotted children
- Any styles on the host element lack encapsulation, and are easily overridden
- No great way to access parent styling - `:host-context` was supposed to handle this but Safari/Firefox are not agreeing to implement
