title: Slots
description: Sort of like React.children
---

- Very familiar to Vue.js devs
- Allows rendering elements inside custom elements
- Slotted elements are in the light DOM (not the shadow DOM) and are not encapsulated
- Multiple named slots supported

```html
<my-fancy-button>
  <span name="the-end">I actually render last</span>
  <span>I am slotted content</span>
</my-fancy-button>
```
